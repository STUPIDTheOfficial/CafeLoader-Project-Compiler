# CafeLoader Project Compiler (Cemu Edition)
A set of scripts to compile projects made for [CafeLoader](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader), but to be loaded on Cemu. With help from [Kinnay](https://github.com/Kinnay) and [Exzap](https://www.reddit.com/user/Exzap/).  
An example can be found [here](https://github.com/aboood40091/NSMBU-haxx).  
You will need devKitPPC, MULTI GreenHills Software and [wiiurpxtool](https://github.com/0CBH0/wiiurpxtool/releases) to build using these scripts. (set their paths in compiler_cemu.py)
